# Examples

This directory contains small demonstration programs showing how to use the modules in this repository.

- **logger_example/**: demonstrates the usage of the logging module by printing messages at different severity levels.
- **queue_example/**: demonstrates the queue (ring buffer) API by enqueueing and dequeueing bytes from a circular buffer.

Each example is self-contained with its own `main.c` and compile instructions. Copy the files into your embedded project or cross-compile environment to run the examples.
